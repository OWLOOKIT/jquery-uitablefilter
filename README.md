# uiTableFilter

- jquery plugin for filtering table rows

# alternatives

This plugin is very light-weight (please [look at the source](https://github.com/gregwebs/jquery-uitablefilter/blob/master/jquery.uitablefilter.js)). I consider it finished, and have no plans to add any features. It works quickly for small data sets without consuming any extra memory (that would be needed for faster filtering).

I often use the [DataTables](http://datatables.net/) plugin when I have greater table needs.

### outside

this is a nice example that ties this plugin with the tablesorter plugin


## usage

              var t = $('table')
              $.uiTableFilter( t, phrase )
            

arguments:

    * jQuery object containing table rows
    * phrase to search for
      - If the phrase contains spaces it will be broken up into separate words that must all match a row

optional arguments:
              $.uiTableFilter( t, phrase, column, ifHidden )

    * column to limit search too (the column title in the table header)
    * ifHidden - callback to execute if one or more elements was hidden


## Warning:

* expects a thead and tbody element
